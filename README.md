# Data-Cleaning-and-EDA
- Data cleaning is an important procedure that involves identifying and correcting errors in your data
- It increases data quality and accuracy, allowing further analysis
- EDA (exploratory data analysis) is an approach used to summarize data ccharacteristics visually and intuitively
- It helps us recognize patterns, correlations, etc...
- Both EDA and data cleaning are needed to tranform data and make it ready for machine learning, deep learning, etc...
- In this repository, I explore several skills, including: dealing with missing values, data formatting, normalization, binning, and visualization.
